# Hunter Weapons

## New Weapon Properties

### Trick
The weapon has two forms that can be switched between in or out of combat
- Spend a bonus action to change forms
- After completing an attack, you can change forms as a free action
- If the form you are changing to has the two-handed property, any item you're carrying in your off-hand can be immediately stowed except for shields

### Chargeable
The weapon can perform a charge attack. As part of an Attack action, you may spend an attack to begin charging the weapon. You are considered to be concentrating, as if on a spell but with extra conditions (does not interfere with actual spell concentration). If you maintain concentration, then on a subsequent turn, you can take the Attack action, and the first attack of the action will be the charge action listed in the weapons description. If any of the following conditions are met, you lose concentration on the charge attack.
- You use your movement (forced movement does not break concentration)
- You use an action, reaction, or bonus action
- You perform an attack
- You receive the stunned or prone conditions
- You lose your weapon
- You fail a concentration check (e.g. you are damaged and fail your Constituion saving throw)

Notes: 
- If the hunter has a bonus action that allows them to perform an attack as part of an Attack action, they may perform this attack before beginning the charge.
- Concentrating on a charge attack is similar to concentrating on a spell but not the same, and you maybe concentrate on both at once if you want to get wild.

### Serrated 
The weapon has sharp, blood-letting teeth, effective at drawing the blood of beasts.
- Double the ability bonus you add to damage rolls with this weapon when attacking an enemy with the Beast trait. For example, if normally you would add your +3 Stength modifer to damage rolls, instead you would add +6 with this weapon. 
- To clarify, not all animals are considered to have the Beast trait. Rather this trait applies only to humans who have given into the Beast Plague and fully transformed into beasts.
- Why does a weapon being serrated only make it more effective against Beasts? Not sure, ask Miyazaki. 

### Fast
This weapon is quick, allowing you to make more attacks than you would normally be able to make.
- You may use a bonus action to attack with this weapon as if it were an off-hand weapon (no stat bonus to damage). You do not need to perform an Attack action in order to make this attack.
- If you have a class feature that does allow you to add your stat bonus to off-hand weapon damage rolls, that applies to Fast weapons as well.

## Melee Weapons

### Hunter's Axe
> "One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner." (https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Hunter+Axe)

The regular form of this weapon is a simple axe, and swung as such. The transformed mode extends the telescopic handle, essentially transforming the weapon into a halberd. The weapon is held with both hands, giving up the left-hand weapon for extended reach and a wider variety of attacks. It has an extended reach and therefore is helpful when you need stay a safer distance away from opponents in melee range.

#### One-handed form:
- 1d8 slashing, trick, chargeable
- Charge attack:
    - 6d8 slashing, target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn if hit

#### Two-handed form:
- 1d12 slashing, two-handed, reach, trick, chargeable
- Charge attack:
    - 5d12 slashing, attack every creature in range (make one attack roll). Targets that are hit are knocked prone.
- Note: When transformed, this weapon counts as a halberd when it comes to the Polearm Master and other feats

### Saw Cleaver
> "One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast." (https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Saw+Cleaver)

Transforms between a saw and an extended cleaver. Classified as serrated while wielded in the default saw form.

#### One-handed form:
- 1d6 slashing, trick, chargeable, serrated, fast
- Charge attack:
    - 6d6 slashing, target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn if hit

#### Two-handed form:
- 1d10 slashing, two-handed, reach, trick, chargeable
- Charge attack:
    - 6d10 slashing, target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn if hit

### Threaded Cane
> "One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul." (https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Threaded+Cane)

This trick weapon transforms between a cane and a notched whip. Note that this weapon is one-handed in both forms.

#### Cane form:
- 1d8 bludgeoning, trick, chargeable, finesse, fast
- Charge attack:
    - 6d8 bludgeoning, target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn if hit

#### Whip form:
- 1d8 slashing, reach (15 feet), trick, chargeable, finesse, serrated
- Charge attack:
    - 6d6 slashing, make one attack roll and hit creatures in a 15-foot cone

### Charge Blade
> This weapon was imported from a far away land with a culture obsessed with the killing and harvesting of innocent beasts. Perhaps the wielder seeks redemption in hunting the not-so-innocent beasts of Yharnam.

This trick weapon is a paired sword and shield that combine together to form a greataxe.

#### Sword/Shield form:

_Sword_
- 1d8 slashing, trick, chargeable
- Charge attack:
    - 6d8 slashing, target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn if hit

_Shield_
- Normal ass shield held in the off-hand, +2 AC
- Shield Block:
    - When attacked (ranged or melee), the wielder may spend their reaction to make a Strength or Constitution saving throw, with the DC being the value of the attack roll. If the save is successful, the attack deals no damage. If the triggering attack was melee, the next attack against the attacker has advantage, as the attacker is off-balance.

#### Axe form:
- 1d12 slashing, trick, reach, chargeable
- Charge attack:
    - 6d12 slashing, target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn if hit

### Chikage
> "Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence." (https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Chikage)

This katana is less of a "trick" weapon and more of a grisly, ghoulish cursed weapon. In its normal form, it is a simple katana. As part of the transformation, the wielder painfully coats the weapon with their own blood, which flows around the sword and extends its reach. This weapon is extremely damaging, but it drains the user's life force when transformed.

#### Normal form:
- 1d8 slashing, trick, chargeable, finesse, versatile
- Charge attack:
    - 6d8 slashing, target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn if hit

#### BLOOD form:
- 1d8 slashing, 1d8 necrotic, two-handed, reach, trick, chargeable, finesse, drain
- Charge attack:
    - 5d8 slashing, 5d8 necrotic, target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn if hit
- Drain: When transformed from normal form to BLOOD form, this weapon deals 1d6 necrotic damage to the wielder. If the sword is in blood form at the end of the wielder's turn, they also receive 1d6 necrotic damage (so it can happen twice in one turn). NOTE: This damage does not trigger the Rally mechanic. It cannot be healed with Rally, but it also doesn't replace the most recent attack in the rally pool.
    - This damage may not be reduced in any way
