# Hunter Firearms

## New Weapon Properties

### Multishot
This weapon fires multiple projectiles. When you make an attack with this weapon, it fires multiple projectiles at once equal to the value of the multishot property, e.g. multishot 4 shoots four projectiles. 
- All shots are separate attack rolls performed at disadvantage. 
- When they hit, they deal the weapon's damage die as normal. 
- Targets outside of the first range increment can only be hit by one projectile. 

### Reload
This weapon has a clip of a certain number of shots. Each attack made with the weapon uses one shot (if the weapon has the multiattack property, each attack still uses one "shot" from the weapon)

You can reload the weapon as a bonus action.

## Ranged Weapons

### Hunter's Pistol
> "Pistol made at the workshop, for hunters stalking beasts. Hunter firearms are specially crafted to employ Quicksilver Bullets fused with the wielder's own blood, boosting damage against beasts. The pistol is a quicker draw than the blunderbuss, allowing for speedier responses to attacks." (https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Hunter+Pistol)

It's a pistol. You can reflavor it as a repeating crossbow if you want that Van Helsing flavor.

- 1d10 piercing, Ammunition (range 100/400), light, reload (6 shots)

### Hunter's Blunderbuss
> "A blunderbuss created at the workshop for the hunters' line of work. Hunter firearms are specially crafted to employ Quicksilver Bullets fused with the wielder's own blood, boosting damage against beasts. The impact of this highly-effective weapon counters beasts' swift movements, and its wide spread is nigh-on guaranteed to hit the mark." (https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Hunter+Blunderbuss)

An old timey shotgun.

- 1d6 piercing, Ammunition (range 5/20), light, reload (2 shots), multishot 3
