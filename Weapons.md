# Hunter Weapons

## New Weapon Properties
----
### Trick
The weapon has two forms that can be switched between in or out of combat
- Spend a bonus action to change forms
- After completing an attack, you can change forms as a free action
- If the form you are changing to has the two-handed property, any item you're carrying in your off-hand can be immediately stowed except for shields

### Chargeable
The weapon can perform a charge attack. You may spend an action to begin charging the weapon. You are considered to be concentrating, as if on a spell with some extra conditions. If you maintain concentration, then on a subsequent turn, you can take the Attack action, and the first attack of the action will be the charge action listed in the weapons description. If any of the following conditions are met, you lose concentration on the charge attack.
- You use your movement (forced movement does not break concentration)
- You use an action, reaction, or bonus action
- You receive the stunned or prone conditions
- You lose your weapon
- You fail a concentration check (e.g. you are damaged and fail your Constituion saving throw)
