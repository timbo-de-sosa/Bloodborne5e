# Mechanics

## Gun Parry
When wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow in their off-hand, hunters have the ability to perform a gun parry. When they are the target of a melee attack, they can use their reaction to make a ranged attack with the weapon (with the normal disadvantage rules applying if an enemy is within five feet). If it hits, their attacker's attack misses, the hunter's gun attack does normal damage, and the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn. If it misses, the creature's attack automatically hits you no matter what they rolled (still critting if that's what they rolled).

## Dodge Roll
Hunters have the ability to perform a dodge roll. When they are the target of an attack (ranged or melee), they can use their reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw, with the DC being the value of the attack roll. If the saving throw fails, the enemy's attack proceeds as normally, and if it hits, the hunter is knocked prone. Hunters wearing heavy armor have disadvantage on the saving throw. 

- Optional rule: The DM is free to reveal the value of the attack roll before announcing whether the hunter was hit. 

## Blood Vials
The Hunter has a stock of Blood Vials, special healing blood ministrations developed by the Healing Church. They are kept in an extra-dimensional pocket (Blood Bag) that only the hunter can access. 
- By default, a hunter's Blood Bag can hold 5 Blood Vials. This limit is called Blood Bag Capacity, and some effects can increase this limit.
- Blood Vials function as Superior healing potions, healing 8d4+8 damage
- Blood Vials can be retrieved and consumed as a bonus action, or they can be administered to a willing or incapacitated creature as an action. 
- Hunters may not acces each other's Blood Bags
- Blood Vials found in the world may be added to the hunter's Blood Bag as long as the Blood Bag Capacity is not surpassed.

## Lantern
Hunters may only perform a short rest when they've found a Hunter's Lantern. They are safe at Lanterns, and no enemies will attack. If a party member dies, they immediately respawn standing at the Lantern at which they've most recently rested, and they are able to run back to the fight.
- When the party finds a Lantern for the first time, resting does not confer any penalties. 
- Resting at a Lantern for the second time causes all non-boss monsters to respawn.
- Resting at a Lantern refill's the hunter's Blood Bag to its maximum capacity.
- Hunters may teleport to and from any Lantern they have discovered. This also causes enemies to respawn.
