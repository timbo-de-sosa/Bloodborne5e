# Mechanics

## Gun Parry
When wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow in their off-hand, hunters have the ability to perform a gun parry. When they are the target of a melee attack, they can use their reaction to make a ranged attack with the weapon (with the normal disadvantage rules applying if an enemy is within five feet). If it hits, their attacker's attack misses, the hunter's gun attack does normal damage, and the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn. If it misses, the creature's attack automatically hits you no matter what they rolled (and still critting if that's what they rolled).

## Dodge Roll
Hunters have the ability to perform a dodge roll. When they are the target of an attack (ranged or melee), they can use their reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw, with the DC being the value of the attack roll. If the saving throw fails, the enemy's attack proceeds as normally, and if it hits, the hunter is knocked prone. Hunters wearing heavy armor have disadvantage on the saving throw. 

- Optional rule: The DM is free to reveal the value of the attack roll before announcing whether the hunter was hit.
