# Bloodborne

## Intro
The city of Yharnam is known the world over for the miraculous Blood Ministrations of its Healing Church, able to cure all manner of diseases. The city produces so much sacred blood that even normal townsfolk partake of it recreationally, to the point where the city produces more blood than alcohol.

You all came to Yharnam seeking a cure for your ailment. You'd just barely made it into the city when your illness overcame you, and you passed out. You awoke strapped to a table, tubes running into your arms, and an old man in a wheelchair offered you a contract. He would fortify you for now using Yharnam's sacred Blood Ministrations, if you agreed to serve the city of Yharnam as a hunter. You agreed, and underwent training with the man, Gehrman (pronounced like "chairman" but with a G).

Your training as a hunter complete, you are setting out into Yharnam on the night of the Hunt. You discovered that Yharnam suffers from what is known as the Beast Plague, an illness that causes humans to become beastlike, lose their reason, and desire only violence. Those afflicted become more bestial, growing fur, claws, elongated arms, and the teeth of predators. The cause of the Plague is not known, but could it have something to do with the blood? 

No matter. The Healing Church culls outbreaks of the Beast Plague though the Hunt, where professional hunters lead the townsfolk to violently purge all infected from the city. Gerhman sent you into the city to do just this, with further instructions to make your way through the city to the Church and inquire about Paleblood, which could be a permanent end to your illness. Even though this is your first Hunt, it seems like it's going to be an exceptionally bad one. As you teleport from the Hunter's Workshop to the Lantern in Central Yharnam, the streets are completely empty, with every door locked shut. You hear screams and burning in the distance, and you feel a cold certainty that anyone, any _thing_ you meet on these streets will want to kill you.
