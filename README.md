## Intro
The city of Yharnam is known the world over for the miraculous Blood Ministrations of its Healing Church, able to cure all manner of diseases. The city produces so much sacred blood that even normal townsfolk partake of it recreationally, to the point where the city produces more blood than alcohol.

You all came to Yharnam seeking a cure for your ailment. You'd just barely made it into the city when your illness overcame you, and you passed out. You awoke strapped to a table, tubes running into your arms, and an old man in a wheelchair offered you a contract. He would fortify you for now using Yharnam's sacred Blood Ministrations, if you agreed to serve the city of Yharnam as a hunter. You agreed, and underwent training with the man, Gehrman (pronounced like "chairman" but with a G).

Your training as a hunter complete, you are setting out into Yharnam on the night of the Hunt. You discovered that Yharnam suffers from what is known as the Beast Plague, an illness that causes humans to become beastlike, lose their reason, and desire only violence. Those afflicted become more bestial, growing fur, claws, elongated arms, and the teeth of predators. The cause of the Plague is not known, but could it have something to do with the blood? 

No matter. The Healing Church culls outbreaks of the Beast Plague though the Hunt, where professional hunters lead the townsfolk to violently purge all infected from the city. Gerhman sent you into the city to do just this, with further instructions to make your way through the city to the Church and inquire about Paleblood, which could be a permanent end to your illness. Even though this is your first Hunt, it seems like it's going to be an exceptionally bad one. As you teleport from the Hunter's Workshop to the Lantern in Central Yharnam, the streets are completely empty, with every door locked shut. You hear screams and burning in the distance, and you feel a cold certainty that anyone, any _thing_ you meet on these streets will want to kill you.

## Character Specs
- Level 10
- No full casters (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
- Outlawed spells:
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
- All fly speeds are zero
- All characters are proficient with all Hunter weapons, including firearms
- Monks may use their bonus action unarmed strike after using Hunter Weapons as if they'd used a monk weapon

## Enemy Behavior
- It will be extremely rare to meet anyone outside who is coherent and doesn't want to kill you. All of the uninfected folks are locked safely behind their doors.
- There's honestly not much use for skills other than Athletics or Acrobatics here, sorry rogues
- Enemies are bloodthirsty and will attack unconscious PCs unless distracted.
- Enemies under the effects of the Beast Plague (which is most of them), are lost in a haze, so they will either be standing around muttering or mindlessly patrolling a simple route. However, groups of enemies standing near each other have fallen into a pack mentality, so when one is disturbed, all will attack. 
- Enemies that are under effects of the Beast Plague but not fully transformed are vicious but simple in their strategies, usually attacking the nearest opponent. Fully transformed beast may be more cunning.
- Enemies under the effects of the Beast Plague know no fear and will fight to the last person, even when victory is hopeless.
